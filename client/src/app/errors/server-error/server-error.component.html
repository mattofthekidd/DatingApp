    Note, this is not how we would normally handle things.
    For the sake of learning we'll be doing it anyway.
    If we went to production we'd remove everything but the 'Internal server error'
 -->
<h4>Internal server error - refreshing the page will make the error disappear</h4>
<ng-container *ngIf="!!error"> <!--I know the !! is not necessary but I like that it makes it clear that we are checking if it exists-->
    <h5 class="text-danger">Error: {{error.message}}</h5>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Note: If you are seeing this then Angular is probably not to blame.</p>
    <p>What to do next?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open browser dev tools! Then check the failing request in the network tab.</li>
        <li>Examine request URL - what API endpoint are you requesting?</li>
        <li>Reproduce the problem in Postman - if we get the same error then Angular is 100% not the problem.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Stack trace below
        - the first few lines will tell you which line of code caused the issue in the API.
